# Software

- [autofd](https://github.com/sail-sg/autofd)\
Provides automatic differentiation for functionals (variational calculus). We use it for density functional theory.

- [jax-xc](https://github.com/sail-sg/jax_xc)\
Exchange correlation functionals translated from libxc to JAX. Towards a deep learning native library for density functional theory (DFT).

- [envpool](https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool)\
High performance, parallel RL environment executor baked with C++.

- [wrap\_dll](https://github.com/mavenlin/wrap_dll)\
Handy tool to inject code into windows DLL. I used it to intercept function calls into the AudioSes.dll, to capture all audio streams played by any application.

# Archived

- [Purine](https://github.com/purine/purine2)\
A distributed deep learning training system developed in the early days.
